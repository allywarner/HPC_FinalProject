\section{Introduction}
A graph is data that is represented with nodes and edges. The nodes are the points of interest and the edges connect and represent the relationship between the nodes. To partition of graph is to divide the graph into smaller components. A good partition is when the number of edges running between separated components is small. In this project, we partitioned an undirected sparse graph using the Lanzcos algorithm [3] to find the second small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.  The principal dataset is available from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection [1]. We partitioned $x$ different graphs and tested full reorthogonalization and no orthogonalization as well as different amounts of Lanzcos iterations on each graph. We visualized the results using Graphviz visualization software [3].
